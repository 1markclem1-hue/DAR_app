# Student Daily Checklist & Time-Management App (FERPA-Safe Master)

## Overview
This web-based application is an instructional support tool designed to help students strengthen executive-functioning skills such as organization, task completion, time awareness, and self-monitoring.

This repository contains a FERPA-safe “master” version that does **not** include any student or staff identifying information by default.

---

## Key Features
- **Daily checklist by class period** (assignment notes + Done/Submitted/Needs Help)
- **Class-period timers** to track time on task
- **Focus timer** to practice working in short intervals
- **End-of-day reflection** (what was finished, submitted, and still needed)
- **One-click printable PDF** for documentation (print or Save as PDF)
- **Weekly summary** to support progress monitoring and documentation
- **Share/Email draft** (creates an email draft; does not send automatically)

---

## Privacy & FERPA Considerations
- The app **does not collect or transmit data automatically**.
- All daily entries are stored **locally in the browser** on the device being used (localStorage).
- The Share/Email feature **does not send emails automatically**; it only creates an email draft the user may choose to send.
- This master version includes **no student names, staff names, or staff emails**.
- Recommended practice: use student **initials only** if needed, and avoid entering personally identifying details in the notes field.

## Intended Use
This tool is intended to support common accommodations and IEP goals related to:
- task initiation and completion
- organization and follow-through
- time management
- self-monitoring and reflection
- adult-supported independence

It is an instructional and organizational support tool and is **not** a grading or disciplinary system.

## Teacher Settings (PIN-Locked)
The app includes a PIN-locked Teacher Settings section to:
- customize the class-period list
- set a neutral storage ID (e.g., studentA_v1)
- adjust the app title/subtitle
- change the Teacher PIN

Note: The PIN is a practical deterrent to prevent accidental edits; it is not a secure authentication system.
